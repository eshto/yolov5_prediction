    """
    My YOLO (You Only Look Once) image prediction model is a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm 
    trained to recognize 20 different objects in images. The model has been meticulously trained on a 
    vast dataset, enabling it to accurately identify and locate various objects within an image. Some 
    of the objects My model can recognize include:
    1. Person
    2. Car
    3. Chair
    4. Bottle
    5. Potted Plant
    6. Bird
    7. Dog
    8. Sofa
    9. Bicycle
    10. Horse
    11. Boat
    12. Motorbike
    13. Cat
    14. TV Monitor
    15. Cow
    16. Sheep
    17. Aeroplane
    18. Train
    19. Dining Table
    20. Bus

    Our YOLO model's efficient architecture allows it to process images in real-time, making it suitable 
    for various applications such as object detection, surveillance, and image analysis. Feel free to 
    explore its capabilities by uploading your own images and witnessing the accurate predictions.

    """
   Using my YOLO image prediction model is simple and intuitive. Follow these steps to get started:
      
    1. **Click the Get Detection Button:**
       After uploading your image, click the "Get Detection" button to initiate the object detection process.
       Our YOLO model will analyze the image and identify the objects present in it.
       
    2. **View the Predictions:**
       Once the detection is complete, the model's predictions will be displayed on the image. Each detected 
       object will be outlined, and its label will be shown. You can explore the predictions and observe the 
       accuracy of the model.
       
    3. **Try Different Images:**
       Feel free to try different images to see how our YOLO model performs across various scenarios. Upload 
       images with different objects and backgrounds to witness the model's versatility.
       
    Please note that the accuracy of the predictions may vary based on the quality and complexity of the 
    uploaded image. Enjoy exploring our YOLO image prediction model!
